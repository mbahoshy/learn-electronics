			<h3>What is a Volt?</h3>
			<p>A volt is a measurement of the potential for electric current. To help imagine this, lets pretend that we a bucket full of water. This bucket has a bottom that slides out, allowing you to control the flow of water. When it is all the way shut, no water is flowing.</p>
			<p>With the bottom all the way closed, there is the potential for water to flow (even though it is not actually flowing). Voltage is a measurement of how much potential there exists for electric flow (even if no electricity is flowing).</p>

		<div class='half fright'>
			<p>Voltage is a measure of potential. Knowing what the voltage is, tells us nothing about whether or not there is electric current.</p>
